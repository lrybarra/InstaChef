###Description

InstaChef is a user friendly, interactive web app intended to encourage more people to cook and bake.

A common misconception is that one must be a culinary chef, in order to cook a meal. It may take some extra skill to create a recipe from scratch or perfect that one perfect recipe. However, **anyone** can cook a simple, flavorful meal given a list of ingredients, along with instructive steps to follow.

The biggest problem when it comes to cooking is understanding the different culinary terms or procedures within the recipe. We are here to change that! InstaChef allows you to search for a recipe and identify commonly used procedures. Alongside the recipe, a user can find the term or procedure along with a GIF demonstrating the procedure.

Some additional features of our application include:
  * quick, interactive resources for measurement conversions and meat temperatures
  * ability to customize recipe and ingredients based on serving size
